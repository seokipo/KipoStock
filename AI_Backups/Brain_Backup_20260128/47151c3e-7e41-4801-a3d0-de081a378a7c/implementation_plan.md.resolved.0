# Implementation Plan - KipoBuy Android App Conversion

Convert the KipoBuy trading system into a professional-grade mobile web application (PWA) suitable for Android devices, with a modular layout and no alarm features.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend Refactoring
#### [MODIFY] [mobile_server.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/mobile_server.py)
- Enhance the FastAPI server to serve a modern, responsive mobile UI.
- Add robust API endpoints for fetching detailed status (holdings, balance, logs).
- Ensure any alarm-related logic is excluded.
- Implement server-side state management for logs to ensure mobile users see recent activity.

### Mobile UI Implementation
#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/static/index.html)
- A single-page application (SPA) structure with Three main sections:
    - **Dashboard**: High-level metrics (Profit/Loss, Status, Today's Change).
    - **Trading/Logs**: Real-time log feed and trading controls (Start/Stop).
    - **Settings**: Interactive forms for Profit/Loss rates, Max stocks, and Condition list.
- Premium aesthetics: Dark mode support, glassmorphism, smooth transitions, and vibrant accents.

#### [NEW] [mobile_ui.css](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/static/css/mobile_ui.css)
- Custom Vanilla CSS for a cohesive, premium look and feel.
- Responsive design optimized for Android screens.

#### [NEW] [mobile_app.js](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/static/js/mobile_app.js)
- Frontend logic for API communication, dynamic UI updates, and tab switching.

### PWA Configuration
#### [MODIFY] [manifest.json](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/manifest.json)
- Update for better "Add to Home Screen" experience on Android with proper icons and theme colors.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- No automated tests currently exist for the UI, so I will perform manual verification of the API endpoints using `curl` or browser tools.
- Verify `GET /api/status` returns expected trading data.

### Manual Verification
1. **Mobile Layout Check**: Open the server on a browser (or simulated mobile view) and verify the 3 sections are well-placed.
2. **Functional Test**: 
    - Click "Start" on mobile and verify the trading logic begins (logs appear).
    - Change a setting (e.g., Profit Rate) and verify it's saved to [settings.json](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/settings.json).
3. **Alarm Absence**: Ensure no "Alarm" or "Sound" options are present in the mobile UI.
