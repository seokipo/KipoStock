# Plan: V5.5.3 Update & Sync Bug Fix

The goal is to finalize version V5.5.3 by fixing a UI synchronization bug and a potential recursive signal crash in the "Sequence Auto" logic, ensuring a stable executable for the English account.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I noticed that the "Sequence Auto" (Blue Play button) log was reading old settings from the file instead of the current UI. I also found a risk of recursive crashes when automatically resetting the button state.

## Proposed Changes

### GUI Logic

#### [MODIFY] [Kipo_GUI_main.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/Kipo_GUI_main.py)
- **Fix UI Sync in Log**: Update [on_seq_auto_toggled](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/Kipo_GUI_main.py#1594-1719) to read the currently selected strategy information from the UI state rather than reloading from [settings.json](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/settings.json).
- **Prevent Recursive Toggle**: Use `blockSignals(True)` when programmatically resetting `btn_seq_auto` (e.g., when it's closed due to market hours) to prevent recursive slot calls.
- **Update Version Labels**: Consistently update all labels (Window Title, Main Label) to `V5.5.3`.

### Build & Branding

#### [MODIFY] [build_exe.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/build_exe.py)
- Ensure the EXE name is set to `KipoStock_V5.5.3_Auto`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Market Closed Check**: Toggle "Sequence Auto" while it's after-market. The button should reliably return to the "Off" state and the popup should appear without crashing.
- **Strategy Color Check**: Change condition strategy colors in the UI and toggle "Sequence Auto". The log report should correctly reflect the NEW colors/strategies.
- **Build Test**: Run [build_exe.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/build_exe.py) and verify that the new EXE is created correctly without path issues on the English account.
