# Walkthrough: KipoStock V4.0 GOLD Release

This major update introduces professional-grade visual feedback and improves system stability for high-frequency monitoring.

## New Features in V4.0

### 1. Color-Coded Trade Logs
Trading success messages in the system log are now automatically colored to match the strategy used:
- 🔴 **Red Message**: 1-Share (Qty) strategy trade.
- 🟢 **Green Message**: Amount (Amt) strategy trade.
- 🔵 **Blue Message**: Ratio (Pct) strategy trade.
- 🟡 **Gold Message**: Sell/Profit-taking notifications.
- This allows you to instantly identify which strategy triggered a trade without reading the details.

### 2. Enhanced Report Stability
The `pnl_amt` error reported in V3.8.2 has been fully resolved. The session reporting engine now uses a standardized data structure to ensure real-time profit/loss calculations are accurate and crash-free.

### 3. V4.0 GOLD Branding
The application has been rebranded as **V4.0 GOLD**, reflecting its multi-strategy capabilities and refined user experience.
