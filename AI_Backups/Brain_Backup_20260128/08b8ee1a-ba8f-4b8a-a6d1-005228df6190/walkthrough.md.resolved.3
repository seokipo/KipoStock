# Walkthrough: KipoStock V3.8.2 UI Refinements

In this update, we focused on enhancing the user interface for condition selection and improving the visibility of active monitoring states.

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Condition Button Numbering
The condition selection buttons (0-9) now clearly display their respective numbers. The styling was adjusted to ensure the text is centered and remains visible regardless of the button's color state.

### 2. Dynamic Real-time Condition List
The "Real-time Condition List" (실시간 조건식) panel now updates automatically whenever a condition's monitoring state is changed.
- **Toggle Sync**: Selecting or deselecting a condition via the 10 buttons immediately reflects in the list.
- **Color Coding**: Conditions in the list are displayed with their assigned strategy color:
  - 🔴 **Red**: 1-Share Strategy
  - 🟢 **Green**: Amount Strategy
  - 🔵 **Blue**: Percent Strategy

### 3. Smart Loading
When the application starts, it automatically populates the condition list based on your last saved settings, including the correct names from the Kiwoom search list.

## Verification Results

### UI Interaction
- Tested cycling through all 4 states for buttons 0-9.
- Verified that the list panel adds/removes items instantly.
- Verified that saving and restarting restores both the button colors and the list content.

### Build
- Successfully generated: `KipoStock_V3.8.2_MULTI.exe`

## How to use the new UI

1. Click a condition button (0-9) to assign a strategy.
2. Watch the "Real-time Condition List" update instantly with the search name.
3. Save settings to apply these changes to the trading engine.
