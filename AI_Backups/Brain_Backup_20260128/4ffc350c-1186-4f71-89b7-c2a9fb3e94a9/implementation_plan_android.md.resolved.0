# Implementation Plan - Android App Transition

Transition the KipoStock application to a high-end Android interface optimized for Galaxy Note 22 Ultra.

## Concept: "Remote Command Center"

Since Korean stock trading APIs (Kiwoom, etc.) often rely on Windows-only 32-bit DLLs, a direct Android port of the *logic* is usually impossible. 

**Solution**:
1.  **PC App (Server)**: The current Python code runs on the PC, handling the trading and API logic.
2.  **Mobile App (Frontend)**: A beautiful, modern web-based app (PWA) that connects to the PC via a secure API to monitor logs, change settings, and send commands (Start/Stop).

## Proposed UI Design (Premium Note 22 Ultra)
- **Dark Mode by default**: Utilizing the OLED screen.
- **Vibrant Neon Accents**: To highlight profit/loss and active status.
- **Glassmorphism**: Sleek, transparent UI elements.
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Optimized for the Note 22's large display and stylus interaction.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Backend Integration
- Add a lightweight web server (e.g., FastAPI) to [Kipo_GUI_main.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy_Gui/Kipo_GUI_main.py) or a separate monitor script.
- Create endpoints for:
    - `GET /status`: Current trading status and logs.
    - `POST /command`: Send Start/Stop/Report commands.
    - `POST /settings`: Update trading parameters wirelessly.

### 2. Mobile Frontend
- Create a modern HTML/CSS/JS dashboard.
- Use WebSockets for real-time log updates (so the logs "scroll" on the phone just like the PC).

## Verification Plan
1.  Create a mockup of the mobile dashboard.
2.  Establish local network communication between phone and PC.
3.  Verify command latency and UI responsiveness on a mobile browser.
