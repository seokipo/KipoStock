# Refine Log UI - Colorize Entire Row

This plan aims to apply the color associated with the buying strategy to the entire line in the trade log (generated by the [today](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/chat_command.py#255-422) command).

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name]

#### [MODIFY] [chat_command.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/chat_command.py)
- Modify the [today](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/chat_command.py#255-422) method to capture the strategy color and wrap the entire row string in a `<font color='...'>` tag.
- Ensure a default color (white or green) is used for lines without a specific strategy.
- Clean up the inner `strat_display` and `cond_display` to not include their own color tags if they are being wrapped by the row-level tag.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None available for GUI appearance, but will check code correctness.

### Manual Verification
- Run the [today](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/chat_command.py#255-422) command in the application and verify that the entire line (including name, amount, profit, etc.) is colored based on the strategy.
- Check the summary line and header to ensure they remain legible (likely default green/white).
