# Save Project to GitHub

This plan outlines the steps to initialize a Git repository in the `KipoStockNow` directory, configure exclusions, and prepare for pushing to GitHub.

## Proposed Changes

### [Git Configuration]

#### [NEW] [.gitignore](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoStockNow/.gitignore)
Create a `.gitignore` file to ensure large or sensitive files are not tracked.
Proposed content:
```text
__pycache__/
.venv/
build/
dist/
*.spec
*.csv
*.log
*.exe
.idea/
.vscode/
```

### [Execution Steps]

1. **Initialize Git**: Run `git init` in `d:\Work\Python\AutoBuy\KipoStockNow`.
2. **Stage and Commit**:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Initial commit for KipoStockNow"`
3. **Connect to GitHub**: 
   - Ask the user for the GitHub Repository URL.
   - Run `git remote add origin <URL>`.
   - Run `git branch -M main`.
   - Run `git push -u origin main`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Steps
- Run `git status` to verify that excluded files (like `__pycache__` and `.venv`) are not being tracked.
- Run `git log` to verify the initial commit was successful.

### Manual Verification
- User will provide the GitHub repository URL.
- User will verify the files appear on their GitHub repository after the push.
