# Walkthrough - `:today` Daily Trade Log & Excel Export

Added a new feature to retrieve and display the daily trading log, including the search condition name for each stock, and providing an option to export the data to Excel (CSV).

## Changes Made

### 1. API Integration ([ka10170](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/acc_diary.py#7-53))
- Created [acc_diary.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/acc_diary.py) to interface with the "당일매매일지조회" API.
- Handles parameters for today's trades and retrieves detailed buy/sell information.

### 2. Search Condition Persistence
- Modified [check_n_buy_1ju.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/check_n_buy_1ju.py) to save the mapping between a stock and the search condition that triggered its purchase into `stock_conditions.json`.
- This ensures that the trade log can show which condition search found each stock, even after multiple program restarts.

### 3. `:today` Command Implementation
- Added the `:today` command to [chat_command.py](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/chat_command.py).
- **Log Display**: Generates a formatted table in the log window showing:
    - [조건식] 종목명
    - 매수 평균가 / 수량 / 총액
    - 매도 평균가 / 수량 / 총액
    - 손익 금액 및 수익률
- **Excel Export**: Automatically saves the data to a CSV file (e.g., `trade_log_20260122.csv`) in the program directory. This file can be opened directly in Excel with correct Korean encoding (UTF-8-SIG).

## How to Use

1. **Check Log**: Type `:today` in the command input box.
2. **View Table**: The trade log will appear in the log window with horizontal lines and aligned columns for easy reading.
3. **Open Excel**: Locate the `trade_log_YYYYMMDD.csv` file in your project folder to view the details in Excel.
4. **Help**: Type [help](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/chat_command.py#343-351) to see the updated command list.

## Executable Build Result

- **Executable Path**: [KipoStock_V4.0_GOLD.exe](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/dist/KipoStock_V4.0_GOLD.exe)
- **Folder**: [dist folder](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/dist/)
- **Note**: The `dist` folder contains the executable and necessary assets ([settings.json](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/settings.json), [StockAlarm.wav](file:///d:/Work/Python/AutoBuy/KipoBuy4.0/StockAlarm.wav)). You should run the EXE from this folder or move both the EXE and its assets together.
